  <h1> On Definitions

<p> We have broken with Counterexamples in a few notable places, mostly to update things like the separation axioms to their more modern useage (where $T_i \Rightarrow T_j$ whenever $i > j$). Our definitions should match those given in e.g. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/General-Topology-Dover-Books-Mathematics/dp/0486434796">Willard's <i>General Topology</i></a>.
